# RAG-with-reranking
Set up a Hybrid Search RAG Pipeline using Hugging Face, FastEmbeddings, and LlamaIndex to load, chunk, index, retrieve, and re-rank documents for accurate query responses. This pipeline leverages vector embeddings, cross-encoder re-ranking, and a language model to deliver precise and contextually relevant answers.
